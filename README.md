## About
This textbook by author Alexander G. Dean gives students an understanding of the most important topics in embedded systems design using a coherent, compelling and hands-on approach. (available as PDF)

## About the 2nd Edition
Now in its 2nd edition, this textbook has been updated on a new development board from STMicroelectronics – the Arm 
Cortex-M0+ based Nucleo-F091RC. Designed to be used in a one- or two-semester introductory course on embedded 
systems, the textbook covers fundamental topics including the CPU, interrupt systems, peripherals, serial communication and 
multi-tasking. Software examples in this textbook are written in C and the free version of Arm’s Keil MDK-ARM integrated 
development environment is used throughout the materials.

## About the 1st Edition
This textbook introduces students to creating embedded systems using the Arm® Cortex®-M0+ CPU-based Kinetis®
KL25 MCU. Topics covered include the CPU, interrupt system, peripherals, and programming. C is used as the 
programming language throughout the text. The concurrent operation of the CPU and peripherals is highlighted 
throughout as critical to creating cost-effective embedded systems. This book gives an early introduction to practical 
multitasking on the CPU, with the goals of improving responsiveness and software modularity while reducing CPU overhead. 
The interplay of interrupts, peripherals and schedulers is examined.
For use in ECE, EE, and CS departments. The book targets the low-cost FRDM-KL25Z MCU development board.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This book may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
